# ðŸš€ Deployment Guide for GodlikeMusic

This guide will walk you through deploying GodlikeMusic to Vercel.

## Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Account** (or GitLab/Bitbucket)
2. **Vercel Account** (free tier is sufficient) - Sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. **YouTube Data API v3 Key** - Get from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)

## Step 1: Get YouTube API Key

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable **YouTube Data API v3**:
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services" â†’ "Library"
   - Search for "YouTube Data API v3"
   - Click "Enable"
4. Create credentials:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" â†’ "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" â†’ "API Key"
   - Copy your API key
   - (Optional but recommended) Restrict the API key to YouTube Data API v3 and your domain

## Step 2: Push to GitHub

If you haven't already pushed to GitHub:

```bash
# Create a new repository on GitHub (don't initialize with README)
# Then run these commands:

git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/godlikemusic.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

### Option A: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard (Recommended for beginners)

1. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
2. Click "Import Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Vercel will auto-detect Next.js - keep the default settings
5. Click "Deploy"
6. Wait for the initial deployment to complete

### Option B: Deploy via Vercel CLI

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel

# For production deployment
vercel --prod
```

### Option C: Use the provided deploy script

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

## Step 4: Add Environment Variables

This is **CRITICAL** - the app won't work without this step!

1. Go to your project in [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click on your project
3. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**
4. Add the following variable:
   - **Name**: `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: Your YouTube Data API v3 key from Step 1
   - **Environments**: Check all three (Production, Preview, Development)
5. Click "Save"

## Step 5: Redeploy (Important!)

After adding environment variables, you need to redeploy:

### Via Dashboard:
1. Go to "Deployments" tab
2. Click the three dots on the latest deployment
3. Click "Redeploy"

### Via CLI:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

## Step 6: Verify Deployment

1. Visit your deployed URL (e.g., `https://godlikemusic.vercel.app`)
2. Test the search functionality
3. Try playing a song
4. Check that the YouTube player loads correctly

## Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues

**Problem**: "YouTube API is not configured" error

**Solution**:
- Verify the environment variable is named exactly: `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`
- Check that it's enabled for Production environment
- Redeploy after adding the variable
- Verify the API key is valid in Google Cloud Console

### Quota Exceeded

**Problem**: "API quota exceeded" error

**Solution**:
- YouTube Data API has a daily quota (10,000 units by default)
- Each search costs ~100 units
- Request quota increase in Google Cloud Console if needed
- The app includes caching to minimize API calls

### Build Errors

**Problem**: Build fails during deployment

**Solution**:
```bash
# Test build locally first
npm run build

# If it works locally but fails on Vercel:
# 1. Check Node.js version (should be 18.x or higher)
# 2. Clear Vercel cache and redeploy
# 3. Check the build logs for specific errors
```

### Player Not Loading

**Problem**: YouTube player doesn't load or shows errors

**Solution**:
- Ensure video IDs are valid
- Check that videos allow embedding
- Verify no ad blockers are interfering
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

## Custom Domain Setup

1. Go to your project in Vercel Dashboard
2. Click "Settings" â†’ "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain
4. Follow the DNS configuration instructions
5. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours)

## Performance Optimization

### Enable Analytics

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard â†’ Your Project â†’ Analytics
2. Enable Vercel Analytics for free performance insights

### Enable Caching

The API routes already include caching headers:
- Search results: 1 hour cache
- Video details: 2 hour cache

### Image Optimization

Next.js Image component is already configured to optimize images from YouTube.

## Monitoring

### Check API Usage

Monitor your YouTube API usage:
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Navigate to "APIs & Services" â†’ "Dashboard"
3. Select "YouTube Data API v3"
4. View quota usage and statistics

### Vercel Logs

View real-time logs:
```bash
vercel logs [deployment-url]
```

Or check logs in Vercel Dashboard â†’ Your Project â†’ Deployments â†’ [Click deployment] â†’ Logs

## Continuous Deployment

Once connected to GitHub, Vercel automatically:
- Deploys every push to the main branch (Production)
- Creates preview deployments for pull requests
- Runs build checks before deployment

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit API keys** to your repository
2. **Use environment variables** for all sensitive data
3. **Restrict API key** usage in Google Cloud Console
4. **Enable HTTP/2** (Vercel does this automatically)
5. **Use HTTPS** (Vercel provides free SSL)

## Scaling Considerations

### Free Tier Limits (Vercel)
- 100 GB bandwidth per month
- Unlimited deployments
- Serverless function execution: 100 GB-hours

### Upgrading
If you exceed free tier limits:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard â†’ Your Team â†’ Billing
2. Upgrade to Pro plan ($20/month) for:
   - 1 TB bandwidth
   - Unlimited team members
   - Advanced analytics
   - Priority support
